Concurrency: the art of doing several things "at the same time".

A thread is a set of instructions

an application can be composed of several threads

can be executed "at the same time".

scheduler is in charge of coordinating threads

cpu resources shared equally, thread waiting from something, thread waiting on another thread or resource

race condition
  accessing data concurrently
  two threads read and write to the same variable at the same time

Singleton prevents multiple instances of the same object

synchronization locks a resource and associates that key a thread so only one thread can access it

key is called a monitor

locks are reentrant

reentrant: when a thread holds a lock, it can enter a block synchronized on the lock it is holding

deadlocks: is a situation where a thread T1 holds a key needed by a thread t2, and t2 holds a key needed by t1
