singleton case study, thread safe

synchronization: works but poor performances

double-check locking: why is it buggy? Hard to detect

Well know pattern from the Gang of Four

tricky in concurrent environment

join releases key,

using a private object key fixes problems

how to write concurrent code

1. check for race conditions
  occur on fields not variables or parameters
  2 threads are reading / writing a given field

2. check for the happens before link
  read / write volatile or synchronized
  otherwise bug

3. synchronized or volatile
  synchronized =  atomicity
  volatile = visibility
